# PluralSingular

**PluralSingular** is a Python module that provides functionality to pluralize and singularize words in multiple languages. Currently, it supports both **Spanish** and **English** through dedicated backends. The module follows a simple interface to make it easy to add support for additional languages.

> **Note:** This is an early release of the module. Contributions, corrections, support for other language backends, and any form of feedback are highly welcome.

## üì¶ **Installation**
```bash
pip install pluralsingular
```

---

## üöÄ **Usage**
To use **PluralSingular**, you can import the main functions directly from the package:

```python
from pluralsingular import pluralize, singularize

# Pluralize and singularize in English (default language)
print(pluralize("dog"))  # 'dogs'
print(singularize("dogs"))  # 'dog'

# Pluralize and singularize in Spanish
print(pluralize("flor", lang="es"))  # 'flores'
print(singularize("flores", lang="es"))  # 'flor'
```

---

## üîß **Functions**

### `pluralize(word: str, lang: str = 'en') -> str`
Pluralizes a given word based on the specified language.

**Arguments:**
- `word` (str): The word to be pluralized.
- `lang` (str, optional): The language to be used for pluralization (default is 'en').

**Returns:**
- `str`: The pluralized form of the word.

**Example:**
```python
print(pluralize("dog"))  # 'dogs'
print(pluralize("futbol", lang="es"))  # 'futboles'
```

### `singularize(word: str, lang: str = 'en') -> str`
Singularizes a given word based on the specified language.

**Arguments:**
- `word` (str): The word to be singularized.
- `lang` (str, optional): The language to be used for singularization (default is 'en').

**Returns:**
- `str`: The singularized form of the word.

**Example:**
```python
print(singularize("dogs"))  # 'dog'
print(singularize("futboles", lang="es"))  # 'futbol'
```

---

## üåç **Supported Languages**
The following languages are supported:
- **English** (default, implemented using the `inflect` package)
- **Spanish** (custom implementation using language-specific rules)

Each language has its own backend, and new languages can be added by following the structure in `pluralsingular/lang/`.

---

## ü§î **How It Works**
The module dynamically loads the appropriate backend for each language when the `pluralize` or `singularize` function is called. The backends are cached to avoid multiple imports. Each backend implements the same interface with two methods:
- **`pluralize(word: str) -> str`**
- **`singularize(word: str) -> str`**

The **Spanish backend** uses a set of rules and exceptions to handle irregular forms, while the **English backend** relies on the `inflect` package for robust pluralization and singularization.

---

## ‚ú® **Features**
- **Multi-language support**: Handle multiple languages with ease.
- **Custom backends**: Easily extend the package to support other languages.
- **Dynamic imports**: Load only what is needed for each language.
- **Exception handling**: Custom handling for irregular words.

## üìö **Examples**

### **Spanish Examples**
```python
from pluralsingular import pluralize, singularize

print(pluralize("flor", lang="es"))  # 'flores'
print(pluralize("luz", lang="es"))  # 'luces'
print(pluralize("pa√≠s", lang="es"))  # 'pa√≠ses'
print(pluralize("rey", lang="es"))  # 'reyes'

print(singularize("flores", lang="es"))  # 'flor'
print(singularize("luces", lang="es"))  # 'luz'
print(singularize("pa√≠ses", lang="es"))  # 'pa√≠s'
print(singularize("reyes", lang="es"))  # 'rey'
```
