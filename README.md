# PluralSingular

**PluralSingular** is a Python module that provides functionality to pluralize and singularize words in multiple languages. The module follows a simple interface to make it easy to add support for additional languages.

The goal of this module is to remain lightweight while handling the most common words correctly. It does not aim for 100% accuracy, but instead strives to cover the most frequent and practical use cases.

> **Note:** This is an early release of the module. Contributions, corrections, support for other language backends, and any form of feedback are highly welcome.

> **Note:** Most language backends have been generated by ChatGPT and may need corrections.



## üì¶ **Installation**
```bash
pip install pluralsingular
```

---

## üöÄ **Usage**
To use **PluralSingular**, you can import the main functions directly from the package:

```python
from pluralsingular import pluralize, singularize

# Pluralize and singularize in English (default language)
print(pluralize("dog"))  # 'dogs'
print(singularize("dogs"))  # 'dog'

# Pluralize and singularize in Spanish
print(pluralize("flor", lang="es"))  # 'flores'
print(singularize("flores", lang="es"))  # 'flor'

# Pluralize and singularize in French
print(pluralize("cheval", lang="fr"))  # 'chevaux'
print(singularize("chevaux", lang="fr"))  # 'cheval'

# Pluralize and singularize in German
print(pluralize("Mann", lang="de"))  # 'M√§nner'
print(singularize("M√§nner", lang="de"))  # 'Mann'

# Pluralize and singularize in Russian
print(pluralize("—á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫", lang="ru"))  # '–ª—é–¥–∏'
print(singularize("–ª—é–¥–∏", lang="ru"))  # '—á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫'
```

## üîß **Functions**

### `pluralize(word: str, lang: str = 'en') -> str`
Pluralizes a given word based on the specified language.

**Arguments:**
- `word` (str): The word to be pluralized.
- `lang` (str, optional): The language to be used for pluralization (default is 'en').

**Returns:**
- `str`: The pluralized form of the word.

**Example:**
```python
print(pluralize("dog"))  # 'dogs'
print(pluralize("futbol", lang="es"))  # 'futboles'
```

---

### `singularize(word: str, lang: str = 'en') -> str`
Singularizes a given word based on the specified language.

**Arguments:**
- `word` (str): The word to be singularized.
- `lang` (str, optional): The language to be used for singularization (default is 'en').

**Returns:**
- `str`: The singularized form of the word.

**Example:**
```python
print(singularize("dogs"))  # 'dog'
print(singularize("futboles", lang="es"))  # 'futbol'
```

---

## üåç **Supported Languages**
The module supports multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Galician, Dutch, Russian, Ukrainian, and Greek. Each language has its own backend, and new languages can be added by following the structure in `pluralsingular/lang/`.

---

## ü§î **How It Works**
The module dynamically loads the appropriate backend for each language when the `pluralize` or `singularize` function is called. The backends are cached to avoid multiple imports. Each backend implements the same interface with two methods:
- **`pluralize(word: str) -> str`**
- **`singularize(word: str) -> str`**

The backends for each language use a combination of **rule-based transformations** and **exception lists** to handle irregular words.

---

## ‚ú® **Features**
- **Multi-language support**: Handle multiple languages with ease.
- **Custom backends**: Easily extend the package to support other languages.
- **Dynamic imports**: Load only what is needed for each language.
- **Exception handling**: Custom handling for irregular words.

---

## üìö **Examples**

### **Spanish Examples**
```python
from pluralsingular import pluralize, singularize

print(pluralize("flor", lang="es"))  # 'flores'
print(pluralize("luz", lang="es"))  # 'luces'
print(pluralize("pa√≠s", lang="es"))  # 'pa√≠ses'
print(pluralize("rey", lang="es"))  # 'reyes'

print(singularize("flores", lang="es"))  # 'flor'
print(singularize("luces", lang="es"))  # 'luz'
print(singularize("pa√≠ses", lang="es"))  # 'pa√≠s'
print(singularize("reyes", lang="es"))  # 'rey'
```
